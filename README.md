# CSharp-Project_3
 This is a project assignment from my MIS15 course at California State University Sacramento.
 It consists of a windows form that would be used for a hypothetical restaurant order.
 The user:
  * selects a table from the combobox
  * clicks "Select Item"
  * a dialog form opens in which the user then enters the order information
  * the user clicks "OK" when done and is returned to the original form where the order details are displayed
  * the user can click "Save" which will open a "save as" dialog so they can choose a location to save the information
